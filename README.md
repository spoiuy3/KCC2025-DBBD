[[paper]](#)  [[code]](https://github.com/spoiuy3/KCC2025-DBBD) This is a result of the 2025 Spring Semester Software Convergence Capstone Design project at Kyung Hee University.
## ðŸ“– Project Summary
This project implements a novel graph neural network model for 3D Scene Graph Generation (3DSSG) that overcomes the limitations of prior methods using bi-directional edge updates and distance-based masking. Unlike traditional GNN-based approaches that only consider unidirectional context or ignore spatial proximity, our method enhances relational reasoning between objects in a point cloud scene by:

- Updating edge features bidirectionally to capture richer mutual context.
- Applying a distance-aware attention mask to focus learning on spatially relevant object pairs.

Our model shows competitive results on the 3DSSG benchmark dataset, outperforming previous baselines (SGPN, FAN) across all relation/object/predicate prediction tasks.

## ðŸ”® Conclusion and Future Work
This implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating bidirectional context propagation and spatial masking in 3D scene graph prediction tasks. Key outcomes include:

- Significant improvement in R@1 and R@3 metrics for relation, object, and predicate prediction.
- Ablation results validate the contribution of distance-based masking to model accuracy.

Future directions:
- Integrate with additional 3D datasets (e.g., ScanNet, S3DIS).
- Apply model to real-time robotic navigation or AR object interaction scenarios.
- Extend the architecture to incorporate multi-modal inputs (e.g., RGB, text, language grounding).
